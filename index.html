	<h1>TIGERS OF THE WORLD</h1>
<p>here are two recognized subspecies of tiger*: the continental (Panthera tigris tigris) and the Sunda (Panthera tigris sondaica). The largest of all the Asian big cats, tigers rely primarily on sight and sound rather than smell for hunting. They typically hunt alone and stalk prey.<br> A tiger can consume more than 80 pounds of meat at one time. On average, tigers give birth to two to four cubs every two years. If all the cubs in one litter die, a second litter may be produced within five months.

Tigers generally gain independence at around two years of age and attain sexual maturity at age three or four for females and four or five years for males.<br> Juvenile mortality is high, howeverâ€”about half of all cubs do not survive more than two years. Tigers have been known to reach up to 20 years of age in the wild.</p>
